Instructions
If your guess is within 10 of the number, the game will return "WARM!"
If it's further than 10 away from the number, it will return "COLD!"
On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
closer to the number than the previous guess it will return "WARMER!"
If farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
Let's see in how much guesses you can win!
